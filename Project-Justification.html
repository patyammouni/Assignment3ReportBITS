    <h1>Beyond current capabilities</h1>
    <p>
         Besides a team of developers, our team’s members are students. Therefore, we all have strengths and weaknesses in one area or the other. 
		We have come to a conclusion that we will be learning through the process by working on the weak areas and using strengths to help each other out. 
	The table below indicates each and every persons strengths and weaknesses. tasks have been issued in areas of improvement in order to develop skills.

	<h1>Project Risks</h1>


	<p> 
As we know advantages come along with disadvantages and vice versa, we have some project risks. Below are some of the risks:<br><br>

	<b>1.</b> Displaying latest news or journals regarding to a specific cyber security topics. 
	This would be one of the major risks as it is a core feature of the project. 
	We can take several measures in order to avoid such as scenario. 
	Such as ensuring the news are latest feed so that it keeps the users updated. Another step to minimize the risk, 
	we look forward to link trusted and latest feeds that filter feeds of interest only.<br><br>

	<b>2.</b> Another risk would be quiz results. We expect the results to be accurate so that the user is well aware and tested properly on a certain topic. 
	To ensure the right results, ensure the structure of the question is well and answers are well set on the quiz form and appropriate code is 
	implemented such as java script and PHP. We shall also ensure routine checks and perform a test before implementing it.<br><br>

	<b>3.</b> An added risk can be proof of achievement. If a failure occurs, one of the risks would be mix up of result sent to individuals. 
	To avod such a scenario, our team shall ensure the email addresses provided are correct and sent to the intended recipient and to confirm 
	that the user will have to register with necessary details.<br><br>
