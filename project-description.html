	<h1>Project Name</h1>	

	<p> Safeme.com </p>

        <h1>What Does it Do?</h1>
        <p>This project is created with a means to help educate young children from the ages of 10+ about internet safety. In an ever so growing world of technology the internet and the billions of devices it encompasses are everywhere and used for a multitude of purposes, both graciously and maliciously. Our site aims to teach our young audience about various concerning and major topics that those of that age group are mainly prone to and potentially affected by.  “40 percent of kids in grades 4-8 reported they connected or chatted online with a stranger” (Enough is Enough) this alone suggests the concerning nature of the internet and the potential situations these young children get into due to being in or around the unknown. Our website aims to educate upon topics such as cyber bulling, scams, what sites are good to visit and what isn’t, types of viruses and more. </p>

        <p>With safety and privacy in the online world being a major concern in today’s society the current generation is most exposed to that and statistics show that children “under age 6 indicates that an overwhelming 85 percent of parents allow their young children to use technology in the home” (Erikson Institute, 2016). This comes with potential issues as these children grow up with technology they become more engaged with it, however becoming unaware of the environments they are entering and exposing themselves to. So with the upcoming generation being ever so more involved with technology the need for understanding what can affect needs to be a part of their education. </p>

        <p>At MultiTech we provide the means and necessary foundation for educating children appropriately by not handing them thousand word reports but providing them small and well detailed statements to give them the knowledge on such environments and issues. Our project offers numerous interactive activities such as quizzes, modules, situational games and more that address these issues in a fun and engaging way allowing the children to be more engaged and more likely to absorb and continue to read about the topics. The site is tolerant and friendly with those who are new and in need of assistance with how to interact with websites. The website also acts as a foundation for teachers and parents who want to sit down with their respective student(s)/kid(s) and go through this with them as a form of lesson. Providing interactive images and attractive colours to keep the site fun and engaging but whilst up keeping the main goal of educating the young audience. </p>
        <h2>Project Aim</h2>
        <p>
            Our group collectively brought this idea to mind when we were discussing our initial ideas. We originally started with the foundation of education and we all wanted to keep to an idea that we could and wanted to create something that taught people and provided them with extensive knowledge into a topic. From driving schools, study apps to finally agreeing on the idea of providing a website that delved into depth the concepts of internet safety for children in an interactive way that was engaging and interesting. <br>
            With all our ideas combined we all were able to put our collective interests of studying and learning to paper and create this project. Whilst at the simplest level this website can be easily achieved with just small texts and pictures but as we all wanted to push the boundaries of our current level of knowledge and experience in the field of HTML, CSS and Javascript we all agreed upon different interactive activities that seemed relatively achievable with various and copious amounts of research but also at the same time challenging to our current achievements. Our site had the aims to be extremely professional in looks and development to actually be presented beyond the scopes of a student assignment but of an actual company product. <br>
            All of us had mostly done Introduction to technology and being involved in such assignment we were able to take on what we learnt from there and be able to direct and evolve our project ideas into something more challenging and exciting. Various aspects of the project idea came from various ideas each individual had from their own individual projects in their first assignment as well as their final project with their own groups.

        <h1>Key Features</h1>
        <p>
            They main features of this project were chosen reinforce our goal of creating an interactive and engaging experience for children to learn proper internet safety. The features
            listed are preliminary and may not be final, but are the basis on which we will start building our system around.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h2>Interactive Modules</h2>
        <p>
            This feature will showcase some scenarios to both teach and reinforce the lessons we’ve set out to teach with our website while remaining in a
            safe environment. The modules will be tailored for each subject and may range from demonstrating how certain scams and predatory business tactics target
            younger audiences to how personal information may be misused if given out freely. As our target audience are young children, the interactivity must be tailored
            towards this audience and thus be both easy to use and understand along with keeping them engaged throughout.
        </p>
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>
            We will Unit Test each individual portion of the module to ensure they work correctly and to spec before moving on Integration Testing to ensure the module
            components work together. Once the more systems have been implemented we will use System Testing to ensure other features can be linked to the modules such
            as articles and quizzes. The outcomes we desire of these tests will  be based on the following user story.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>

            As a User I want to learn about Cyber Security in a fun and interactive way using the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given:
        </p>
        <p>
            I am on the webpage
        </p>
        <p>
            When:
        </p>
        <p>
            I have read and understood the scenario guide and instructions<br />
            I have clicked on the Start Lesson button
        </p>
        <p>
            Then:
        </p>
        <p>
            A Scenario will play out where the user must take care to not be fooled into submitting their info onto malicious websites or download shady applications.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h2>Quizzes</h2>
        <p>
            This feature helps reinforce the teachings of our various modules and lessons we have to offer on the site. The quizzes will take place at the end of a module
            and ask questions related to the topics covered, as the target audience of the site is towards young children and to make this feature simpler to implement it will only
            have multiple choice questions. This feature can be enhanced by creating a large pool of questions that can be asked and only choosing a few at a time per attempt, this will help make the quizzes actually
            test the user on knowledge of the topic rather than just memorisation of the questions. We should refrain from focusing on the user Passing or Failing the quiz and instead focus on giving them feedback and motivating them to learn more.
        </p>
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>
            We will first use Unit Testing to ensure that the quiz system in isolation can work, after the corresponding module has been completed we will do Integration T
            esting to ensure that the quiz can correctly refer back to the module. Once more of the features are implemented we can move onto System Testing to ensure the
            system as a whole can work together correctly without any error. The outcomes we desire from these tests are based on the following user story.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>

            As a User I want to be able to demonstrate that I’ve the lessons of the Privacy module by completing a quiz.

            Then:
        </p>
        <p>
            The correct answers will be shown along with explanations, incorrect answers  will be highlighted and common misconceptions that lead to that wrong answer will be addressed.
        </p>

    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h2>Articles</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to interactive lessons, the website will still feature spaces where more traditional forms of conveying information will be hosted such as text articles.
            While many of these articles will be aimed at children, There will be some aimed at parents and guardians and may go into more depth into the subjects. The articles may
            range from simple guides for recognising scams, to information regarding password management.
        </p>
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>
            We will use Unit Testing to ensure that the articles appear correctly, the Integration Testing will focus on allowing the articles to be linked to and from relevant modules
            and other articles. The outcomes. The outcomes we desire of these tests will  be based on the following user story.

    <div>
        <h2>Proof of Achievement</h2>
        <p>
            When completing modules on the website the user may opt in to receiving personalised proof of achievement. There could be a few possible implementations for this feature,
            ranging from having the user input an email at the end of the module for the personalized certificate to be sent to, or for the User to enter details at the end of the module
            and the certificate to be generated along with a download link. This proof of achievement will create a lasting positive relation with our website and give the user something
            tangible they can look back upon.
        </p>
        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>
            We will use Unit Testing to ensure that the Proof of Achievement can be correctly generated using the imputed details, we will also need to be able to test that the system can
            correctly email it out. The Integration Testing will focus on ensuring that the Proof is only generated once the User completes a module and is able to use previously saved details.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>
            Then:
        </p>
        <p>
            I will get an email from which I can download my Proof of Achievement
        </p>

    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
        <h2>
            Parents and Guardians
        </h2>
        <p>
            The website will have an individual section regarding information for guardians or teachers. Such information could include:
            <ul>
                <li>What to do if your child is getting cyberbullied</li>
                <li>Discerning whether a webiste is safe for your child</li>
                <li>How to regulate a child's internet activities</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example: <br>
            A parent who is registering with their child to the website also wants to educate themselves about internet safety, in which case they see a section called “Guardians and Teachers”. This then leads them to a variety of content as well as articles and sources which will be able to educate them on the subject matter.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>
            This section does not present any intensive functionality and as such would only need a simple unit test and perhaps an integration test just to see if it functions, as well as to see if it is able to be accessed normally.
        </p>


    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Anonymous Message Box</h2>
        <p>
            Within the a section of the website called “Contact Us” or a similar category there will be an anonymous message box where users will be able to contact various support staff in case of a personal problem which needs to be addressed (such as cyberbullying)
        </p>
        <h3>
            Validation
        </h3>
        <p>
            To validate this function, unit testing will be conducted to ensure its functionality, as well as performance testing to gauge the amount of traffic the system allows, wherein it will have to pass a certain load of traffic in a timeframe.
        </p>

        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>

            As a User I want to be able to ask a staff member directly about my Internet Safety question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given:
        </p>
        <p>
