        <h1>Project Processes</h1>

        <h2>Working as a Team</h2>

        <p> 
            The benefits we’ve learned from working in a team is the ability for each member to
             compensate for skills and knowledge that others may lack, creating a much deeper 
             skill set overall. They can also act as a motivator for members to keep on schedule 
             as there are others who they must answer to besides themselves, which can help create a 
             drive to complete their tasks. In a large project such as this, which requires a very diverse 
             skill set and continued work, it is clear that a team setting allowed us to accomplish much more 
             than any individual could. We learned during this project the value of having roles within the team,
            as this group was formed casually and without set structure, it was up to the group itself to designate
            roles such as team leader, who created and managed work spaces etc. The value of having roles within 
            the group allows each member to be able to focus on their own responsibilities and reduce friction
            between members. Structure and scheduling was found to be key to a groups success as having set times
            planned for group meetings and such made it easier for member to be able to coordinate their efforts and
            to manage workflow, while each member may have a different pace to how they work, having a schedule
             that all member can adhere to allowed everyone to work together with more cohesion.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p> 
                
                There has been some difficulties with the group, mainly stemming from the lockdown. As 
                there has been no face to face meetings it has been more difficult to share our progress and to
                 coordinate our projects. This lockdown has also affected many members in different ways and thus
                  there have been some challenges we’ve had to overcome in regards to availability and technical 
                  issues such as network downages. The communication we’ve used has been mostly unchanged since 
                  the start of the project, mostly consisting of Microsoft Team for both text chat and meetings. 
                  Outside of this we’ve also used Github and Trello to collaborate our efforts, all of our communication
                   methods have serviced us adequately during this project and we have not needed to search for an alternative. 

                </p>
                <br>

            <h2>Insight from Mentors and Lecturers</h2>

            <p> 
                
                We have taken the advice and guidance of our lecturer and tutorial mentors to heart. Trevor has given us
                 much advice such as help in the formatting and presentation of our webpage and how to highlight certain 
                 features to our target audience, presenting our progress to him every week has also allowed us to thrive 
                 some more thought and reflection into our work. Dr.B has also helped us focus on what we want the project 
                 to be and also pushed us to try and test our limits and to attempt greater scopes than we would have otherwise.

            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

            
            <p> 
                The most important aspect to having a well functioning team is to have good structure and organisation, as
                 stated having a schedule each member can adhere to and being able to accurately assign roles to team members
                  helps keep the team cohesive. Of course it still pays to be flexible and should the roles and/or schedule need
                   to be changed to accommodate any new circumstances or understanding, you should make the changes needed to little 
                   friction and needless to say, having respect and understanding between team members is a must have for a functioning team.
                    If we were to start again, changes we would enact would be to get organised quicker. Spending some time at the start to
                     make a workable schedule to abide by would pay off on its own as it would mean less time during meetings would be needed
                      to set what our goals are for the week.
