            <h2>Challenge 4:</h2>
            <p>
				Our plans over time did change due to time constraints. More meetings were undertaken to help each other and go through each feature to ensure that we had the basics down and that each individual was on the right track. Our plan has been perfect all the way through to this report and only has changed in the form of the amount of meetings we had. Within the scope of our plan everything has been fluent in submissions and task completions. This was due to the continous meetings we had to update each other and everyone's ability to communicate with one another, allowing for greater efficiency and effectiveness throughout the entirety of the project. In terms of completing tasks differently we recommended to each other as feedback to hold not just meetings but group coding sessions where we would come together for an hour or two and develop a major component together where each individual had a role to play in the process which would quicken the development time of the feature.

            <h2>Challenge 5:</h2>
            <p>
				The time between each submission was realistic and with our consistent meetings we were able to get tasks completed well before the deadline. A1, A2 and A3 have been significant components and each of which was efficiently divided up into smaller tasks for each individual to complete within their own timetable slots and each individual was able to communicate their availability, allowing for such tasks to be allocated accordingly and appropriately.  With the current knowledge we have now the time periods in which we all completed our tasks by were perfect as it gave enough time for research, development, testing and reviewing all before submission.

            <h2>Challenge 6:</h2>
            <p>
				Trello, Teams and Github were all collaborative tools we used to effectively and efficiently complete tasks. Each tool used has worked greatly allowing us to successfully submit well before the deadline. However, due to some of our limited experiences with Github there were at times some merging problems which caused us to have problems in files forcing us to recreate repositories. Beyond the constraints of time and skills there were no major risks involved that affected our ability to complete tasks.
