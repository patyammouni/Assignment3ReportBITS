                Communication was something our team had no problems with. We have had meetings at least once a week in
                which each member would share their progress or issues and provide feedback to each other, this has
                helped keep the group on track and complete tasks in a timely manner. Most people in the group were new
                to Javascript and PHP therefore working with it was fairly difficult. Creating the actual learning
                material that would be taught quite time consuming as none of us were exactly experts on the topic.
                Only unexpected problem we had was that some members had issues with Github such as not being able to
                commit/push to the repository but these were eventually resolved.

            <p>
                One challenge we were expecting was implementing the quiz feature in terms of calculating quiz results and
                ensuring it reflects the users understanding of the subject. We addressed this by ensuring the questions
                are structured well and appropriate for our target audience (ages 10-15) and to calculate the results,
                we used javascript to keep track of correct answers and then check if the user has gotten enough correct
                answers (75%) to complete the module. Another expected challenge was the proof of achievement,
                particularly figuring out how to send users their email certificate. This was resolved as we were able
                to do it through email with the user’s providing their email address (after email is checked to being in
                correct format), this ensured minimum errors and an easy way for users to validate their work.

                Doing this project has allowed us to learn new skills related to web programming as well as develop our
                ability to use github effectively. HTML and CSS were something most of us were already comfortable with
                but was consolidated further, for instance when using CSS to display graphics correctly. Javascript on
                the other hand was something none of us were familiar with however it was a valuable skill we learned
                when making our website an interactive experience for users. Although there were some issues with
                github, everyone was also able to consolidate on how to use it effectively when collaborating on a
                project. Some members were also able to expand their knowledge of PHP through implementing features like
                the proof of achievement and quiz feature.

            <p>
                Our plans over time did change due to time constraints. More meetings were undertaken to help each other
                and go through each feature to ensure that we had the basics down and that each individual was on the
                right track. Our plan has been perfect all the way through to this report and only has changed in the
                form of the amount of meetings we had. Within the scope of our plan everything has been fluent in
                submissions and task completions. This was due to the continous meetings we had to update each other and
                everyone's ability to communicate with one another, allowing for greater efficiency and effectiveness
                throughout the entirety of the project. In terms of completing tasks differently we recommended to each
                other as feedback to hold not just meetings but group coding sessions where we would come together for
                an hour or two and develop a major component together where each individual had a role to play in the
                process which would quicken the development time of the feature.

                The time between each submission was realistic and with our consistent meetings we were able to get
                tasks completed well before the deadline. A1, A2 and A3 have been significant components and each of
                which was efficiently divided up into smaller tasks for each individual to complete within their own
                timetable slots and each individual was able to communicate their availability, allowing for such tasks
                to be allocated accordingly and appropriately. With the current knowledge we have now the time periods
                in which we all completed our tasks by were perfect as it gave enough time for research, development,
                testing and reviewing all before submission.

            <p>
                Trello, Teams and Github were all collaborative tools we used to effectively and efficiently complete
                tasks. Each tool used has worked greatly allowing us to successfully submit well before the deadline.
                However, due to some of our limited experiences with Github there were at times some merging problems
                which caused us to have problems in files forcing us to recreate repositories. Beyond the constraints of
                time and skills there were no major risks involved that affected our ability to complete tasks.
