                <h2>Group Expectations:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Meetings can range from 15 minutes to an hour depending on the discussion. We will aim to meet
                        weekly just to ensure that everyone is on target and does not need any extra help so we are able
                        to finish assignments on time and ensure that is up to the standard we want it to be.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        During meetings we are expecting all members to be engaged in the conversation and try to be
                        involved, whether that's by giving ideas, contributing in discussions or sharing work. We don’t
                        expect everyone to talk if they don’t want to but aim to stay engaged via the chat so we know
                        you are focused in the meeting and not getting easily side tracked.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        All members should be respectful to each other and allow everyone to give in their ideas without
                        feeling that their idea will get shut down. We aim to ensure all members have a fair say on the
                        decisions made within the group and not be left out.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        When given/allocated a task we expect all members to complete it to the best of their abilities
                        and ask questions if they need help or don’t understand what is being asked, this will ensure
                        that assignments are completed on time and to the standard we want.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If members have finished tasks earlier than expected, we ask for those to try and help others
                        finish their tasks if needed. This will allow for due dates of specific tasks to be completed
                        earlier and gives ample time to review all sections of the assignment to ensure it has been
                        completed correctly.

        <h2>Consequence for Unmet Expectations or Other Problems:</h2>
        <p>
            If expectations are not met and a member has not gone above and beyond their way to seek assistance with the
            task that was given to them, it will be noted that the member did not complete their section of the tasks on
            time and did not seek assistance which can lead to a reduction of marks to that member and your position in
            the group to be reviewed by the mentor if it continues.
        </p>

        <div class="team-role">
            <h2>Method of Feedback:</h2>
            <p>When a message has been sent to Microsoft Teams we expect members to have at least responded within 24hrs
                the message was sent. This will allow members to enhance their skills and knowledge in group discussions
                as all members are having an input and it will also ensure that they are able to complete their tasks
                smoothly.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tools used in Weekly Workflow:</h2>
        <p>
            The use of Microsoft Teams allows for weekly meetings to be arranged with all group members to ensure that
            everyone is staying on track with their tasks and are able to complete it on the set date. This will be
            complimented with the use of Trello as it enables members of the group to monitor themselves based on the
            set targets that the group has set up using Trello and allow other members to check which tasks have been
            completed and where others may need assistance. Furthermore GitHub will also ensure that all members are
            able to contribute to the HTML by adding in the tasks that have been delegated to them.
