    <h1>Resources and Tools</h1>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank"><b>HTML</b></a>
        <br>
        HTML is the most popular markup Language for creating the structure and presentation of web pages. We will be using the latest version of HTML (which is currently version 5.2), and there are no costs associated with using this tool. Since our project is entirely web-based, HTML will be our most important and most used tool as all our web pages will need to be written out with HTML. No Alternatives to HTML were considered since everyone in our group is familiar with it and because there aren't really any other markup languages that work with browsers.
        <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank"><b>CSS</b></a>
        <br>
        Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the style of a HTML document and determining how HTML elements should be displayed. We will be using the latest version of CSS (version 3), and there are no costs associated with using this tool. CSS will be vital in creating our website as it allows us to design how elements on a page look, position these elements and create animations among other visual features that will make our website appealing to our young audience. CSS is the only style sheet language that can be used with HTML therefore no alternatives could be considered.
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank"><b>Javascript</b></a>
        <br>
        JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that runs on the browser. We will be using the latest version of Javascript, and there are no costs associated with using this tool. Javascript can be used to add interactive elements to a web page, such as creating search boxes, playing videos/audios or show/hide information with a click of a button. Our project has several features that require our user to interact with the website which Javascript can help implement. For instance the quiz feature will need Javascript to track answers input by the user, check if it is correct and indicate if it is without reloading the whole page. Alternatives include <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeScript</a>, <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a> or <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> but we have chosen to go with Javascript since it is supported by all browsers and offers the richest feature set.

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/kids" target="_blank"><b>eSafety kids website</b></a>
        <br>
        ESafety kids is a website made by the Australian Government intended to teach kids about internet safety and help them deal with related issues they may be facing. Since we don't have a thorough understanding on aspects of cyber safety, the eSafety website will serve as an useful reference for the material that will be taught in our website. We looked at alternative government sites that also teach online safety to kids from <a href="https://www.netsafe.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://www.saferinternet.org.uk/" target="_blank">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx" target="_blank">Canada</a> among others but found the eSafety kids website has the most comprehensive source of information that is also relevant to kids
        <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Collaborative Workspaces</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Microsoft Teams</b>
        <br>
        Microsoft Teams will be our group's primary medium for communications. Teams will provide a professional platform for us to discuss our project through texts and host our online meetings. All our texts will be saved and meetings can be easily recorded for future reference if needed. Everyone in our group has also worked with Teams in prior semesters so will be familiar with how it works.
        <br>

        <a href="https://trello.com/b/3xt1rTLW/group-430-bit-stardust" target="_blank"><b>Trello</b></a>
        <br>
        Trello will be used to plan the project and provide an overview of our progress. Our group members will be using the checklist feature to indicate what each person will be doing each week and what has already been done to be better informed on what exactly everyone is up to. Features that need to be created and steps needed to achieve them will also be visualised in Trello with milestones to indicate how we're doing. Thus, Trello will also serve to measure the progression of the assignment/project. Links to other collaborative workspaces are also available here.
        <br>

        <a href="https://github.com/patyammouni/Assignment2BIT" target="_blank"><b>Github</b></a>
        <br>
        A Github repository will be used to cooperate and bring the project together. Github allows users to share documents and commit changes to each other's documents. We will be using Github to upload project-related files to a single location that is available to each member. This will greatly benefit our teams ability to cooperate as all of us are able to review each other's work and make improvements that others can easily identify. Our Github repository has already been set up with all group members having been invited and have the link to it.
