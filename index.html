            <h2>Patrick - S3782644@student.rmit.edu.au</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Patrick and I am born and raised in Victoria. I have lived my entire life in the eastern suburbs about 25 minutes from the city. I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology and in my second year of RMIT. I recently swapped courses from Bachelor of Information Systems (Applied) as I didn't feel as if I was enjoying it and wanted to be more involved in the IT side of things. One of my favourite hobbies is playing basketball, being an avid fan of the NBA and play basketball up to 3 times a week, I enjoy the sport. I have an interest in IT and did 3 years
                of IT related subjects throughout highschool from programming to database designs. I don't have any experience as of now in any field of IT but I have expressed interest towards web development mainly the front end web developed being HTML, CSS, Javascript. I believe my strong points are communication, delegation, planning and teamwork amongst various HTML and CSS knowledge which I would love to build on. To follow up with my interest in IT my weakness is javascript, php and I am currently limited with my knowledge of HTML and CSS and extremely keen to learn that. I can contribute to this team in various ways such as the front end development of the sites in which I can design and create content for. Delegating tasks and various information and to also uphold the highest of standards amongst my peers.

            <h2>Densel - s3840346@student.rmit.edu.au</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Densel-Jharvis Hashim. I am an Australian citizen with a Turkish and Philippines background,
                however I speak English at home due to only knowing a few words in those respective languages.
                I attended Lynbrook Primary School and moved to Narre Warren South P-12 College in the 7th grade
                where I would end up choosing the VCE pathway as I believed it was the most appropriate path for me to
                take throughout my final years of schooling in which I am now studying Bachelor of Information Technology
                at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). My main hobby would be that I am a sport fanatic as
                I tend to watch a lot of main sports such as football and basketball. I have always been interested in IT
                throughout my schooling as I had done subjects related to IT, however it was not until the last 3 years of
                high school where I saw IT as a potential career for me in the future. I don't think I have a lot of strong
                points yet as I am still trying to develop my skills, however I feel more comfortable in HTML and CSS even
                thought I still have a lot to learn. In contrast, my weakness in IT would be Javascript, PHP and Java as I have
                had little to no experience with them, nevertheless I am determined to learn and get better in those areas of IT
                as I continue to grow my knowledge and skillset. In terms of the project the coding side would be most difficult
                for me as I am still learning, but I will be able to contribute with anything related to content as I am more
                comfortable in that area.

            <p>
                My name is Jerin and I was born in the state of Tamil Nadu, India and lived there for about six years and moved to Queensland in 2007 before settling in Victoria. My hobbies are playing strategy games or any coop games with friends and also learning about history particularly twentieth century history. Last year I managed to complete VCE and am currently in my first year of University at RMIT. I'm still not 100% sure what i would like to do in the future but i have an interest in IT and especially programming and all the things that people have done with it, and therefore have decided to do the Bachelor of Information Technology program at RMIT. Currently i think i would like to pursue a career as either a software developer or games programmer. I think my strongpoint right now would be Java since I have used that the most from semester one, although I still have a lot to learn. From this project I would like to learn more about backend web development languages like php or javascript since I'm currently clueless on this stuff, and learning this would generally be a useful skill to have. My challenges in the context of this project would be to communicate more to peers and develop my skills. I see myself contributing to frontend web development in our project but am open to doing other tasks our project requires.

                My name is Matthew Tabbada. I was born in Manilla Philippines and have spent my early childhood there, however I have spent all of my educational life in Australia (Years Transition - 12).
                I am not native from Melbourne and completed my schooling in the NT, graduating from St Philips College, Alice Springs. During my Secondary education I received various Digital Technology Achievements and rewards, which spurred my interest in IT and lead me to pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include indulging in old films, playing video games and occasionally jumping headfirst to anything that interests me. In addition to various academic achievements related to IT, I have also held two casual IT positions which gives me some small experience within an IT workplace. Whilst I have a broad interest in IT currently (and do not have a focused interest at the moment), I currently have strengths in the basics of HTML, CSS and Java. I also believe that I have a strengths within fluid communication and collaboration with colleagues, and would like to build upon more team skills as well as build upon my existing knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as learn more about JavaScript. I am determined to contribute to the team whilst also learning from other’s strengths along the way.

                My name is Nirav Mavji Raghvani. I am an international student from Kenya. I came to Melbourne for my further education at RMIT.
                I have the best experience so far.I have always had an interest in Information technology from a very young age where i used to love exploring how computers work
                and used to take parts apart being eager to know whats inside. This is where my interests arose and followed the path to progression towards an IT carrer from high school
                I really enjoy playing badminton and explore new places on foot (hiking). Previously I have come accross development of websites when i was undergoing my Diploma in
                computing and systems development and have experienced coding in HTML,CSS and a little bit of PHP.
                In the future i would like to be helpful to people using my IT skills to help solve real world problems.
                I would like to polish my skills on HTML and CSS at a high level by the end of the programme.
                Currently as a team member, I have an input in HTML, CSS and managing Microsoft Teams.
                Some of the challenges I am expecting during this period is working remotely, this is one aspect I have considered to work on and eliminate.
                Taking small steps to reach the goal, I have a team that works together to come up with solutions. we call our selves team Multi-Tech.

            <p>
                Having recently completed my degree in Biological Science I am now set to tackle the wild world of IT. Growing up in the semi-rural of Lakes Entrance I
                developed an appreciation for Information Technology as computers were a rare commodity and being able to communicate easily with the outside world was a novel concept.
                I have used some tools such as Unity to create very small scale project but now I seek to learn the skills necessary to take these projects to the next level. While I do have
                a good understanding of the basics of Java, I am not as well read on other languages including HTML and CSS but I see this as an opportunity tp gain some practical understanding
                of these languages and improve in these areas. While this project does have some requirments of design and UX, I see myself contributing more to the implimentation of the project as
                I excel when able to work on concrete problems.

            <h2>Motivations:</h2>
            <p>
				Having discussed for hours on end about the initial project we were undertaking we wanted to delve into a problem and come out with a solution rather than providing a new solution to the world. We believed that SafeMe was a necessary project to undertake to provide children with an easy and engaging means of information that helps them guide their way through internet services in a safe and secure manner. Educating them in a fun way whilst providing them with information that is super informative and understandable by their age group. Upon designing the site and going through the many sites that provided children based internet education we established that these sites were just illustrations and text and we wanted to provide more than just that. We aimed for colours, interactivity, drawings, quizzes and many more features to engage the audience, providing them a foundation for internet safety education. SafeMe is a site that enables all the to come together cohesively and it was our motivation of providing a free service to help the younger generations learn more about the unknown to them.

            <h2>Aims:</h2>
            <p>
				Our aim at Multitech is to "Provide A Free Platform For Educating Younger Generations About Internet Safety". This is our main aim we established right from the beginning of starting this project as it was part of our passion to ensure we develop something that not just us could improve our web development skills on but to also help individuals become smarter and safer users of the web.

            </p>
				<h3>Goal 1: Provide A Free Platform</h3>
					<p>Free in today's world is hazy as many sites claim to be free but require you to login to access content but then it is limited due to needing a subscription to access this content. When it comes to education we believe it should be free and on our site we have a goal to make all facets of it free to every user without any ads or subscription based services. All the content is fully accessible and readily available to learn from. </p>
				<h3>Goal 2: Engaging Content</h3>
					<p>Establishing a site for a younger audience is both fun but challenging. This is due to the demographic of our audience requiring more visuals and interactive content for them to learn in various ways. We wanted to provide various ways for any individual to learn to account for all learning styles with such implementations of quizzes, clickable dilemma games, certificates, videos and images for greater depth. This enables the user to constantly shift their focus between activities and not have to read through hundreds of words just to learn a topic. More engaging interactive content is vital for us to achieve in the success of this project. </p>
					<h3>Goal 3: Extended Features </h3>
					<p>Beyond the scope of our minium viable features we had various amounts of features we would love to implement in the future to provide even more engaging platforms and tasks. Due to the timeline we are keeping within this goal is potentially forseeable in the near future and with an ever so growing audience continuous updates to this project could be made to extend the site.  </p>

        </div>
        <div class="author-info-description">
            <h2>Scope:</h2>
            <p>
				The scope of our solution was based on the 5 fundamental feautures we planned to implement into the SafeMe site being Modules, Achievement system, Quizzes, Annoymous messaging box and popup interactive facts. Upon other details in relation to the design of the site to reflect the demographic our project being children we also needed to implement various images, videos, colours and illustrations to enhance the sites interactability and engagement. The outcome of this project is to educate an individual with the means to go about into the internet and search freely without any issues as they will have been educated on what is safe, how to protect their accounts, malicious content and more which through these topics will provide them with the fundamental knowledge to be smarter and safer users of the web.
